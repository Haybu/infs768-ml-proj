A Python sklearn machine learning to train and test a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Neural Network classifiers. MNIST handwritten digits dataset is used.

To run:

1- unzip this zip file somewhere in your system and get into the directory of project home directory
2- install anaconda from https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html
3- create a new environment:   
  $ conda create -n myenv
4- activate the new environment:
  $ source activate myenv
5- install the packages below:
  $ conda install -y scikit-learn
  $ conda install -y matplotlib
6- run any of the classifiers:
  $ python ./logistic-regression
  or
  $ python ./neural-network.py
  or
  $ python ./decision-tree.py

Please note, each program takes time to fit and test the model.
